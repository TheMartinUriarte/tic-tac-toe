//This is a weekend project assigned by the instructors at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course in San Francisco.

//This project is to have us, the students, create a Tic-Tac-Toe game with the use of Bootstrap and present it to the class on Monday 10/31/16.

//Since I am currently unfamiliar with Bootstrap, you will find notations all throughout the code.

//This is to serve as a point of reference for me when I return and am required to explain my work to my fellow classmates or instructors.

//LEGEND:
//DF = Default. The code given to me at the start of the assignment.
